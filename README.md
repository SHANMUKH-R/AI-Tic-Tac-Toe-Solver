## Minimax Algorithm
Minimax is a recursive algorithm which is used to choose an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. As its name suggests, its goal is to minimize the maximum loss (minimize the worst case scenario).
Minimax algorithm that is widely and successfully used across the fields like Artificial Intelligence, Gaming Theory etc.

## Tic-tac-toe, the most played game in one's childhood
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum and perfect information game. It means that each participant’s gain is equal to the other participants’ losses and we know everything about the current game state.
In a two-player (A vs B) game, if player A scores x points (utility units), player B loses x points. Total gains/losses always sum up to 0.
